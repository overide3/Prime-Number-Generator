# Prime-Number-Generator #

This is a program to find a list of prime numbers. This was an optimisation project to find prime numbers the fastest and with the least memory usage.

This creates an array and a file with all the prime numbers it has found. There is an issue with how to close the program however this would cause major slowdowns and majorly increase the complexity of the code.
